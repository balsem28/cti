This technique is often used by attackers to prevent the victim from accessing important information, such as financial records or personal data. By encrypting the data, the attacker can ensure that only they have the decryption key, making it difficult for the victim to recover their data. This technique is often used in ransomware attacks, where the attacker demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. The T1484 technique is also known as data encryption or data obfuscation.<|end_of_text|>\n<|begin_of_text|>You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence.

It is one of the key objectives of a cyber attack and is often achieved through the use of malware or other persistent tools. Once an adversary has achieved persistence, they can continue to monitor and control the compromised system or network, and potentially launch additional attacks or exfiltrate sensitive data.\nThe other options (Command and Control, Exfiltration Over Command and Control, and Lateral Movement) are all important aspects of a cyber attack, but do not necessarily require persistence to be\n<|begin_of_text|>You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence.
